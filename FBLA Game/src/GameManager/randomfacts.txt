Specifically, one billion seconds is  31.69 years or a little more than     11,574 days. And my one billion       seconds milestone occurs this coming  Sunday, August 18th. A billion        seconds sounds like a long time:      After all, a billion is a pretty big  number.
The Golden Gate Bridge's clearance    above high water averages 220 feet    (67 m) while its towers, at 746 feet  (227 m) above the water, were the     world's tallest on a suspension       bridge until 1998 when bridges in     Denmark   and Japan were completed.
If you have blue eyes, you may be     related to every other blue-eyed      person in the world. Researchers in   Denmark have found that every person  with blue eyes descends from just one "founder," an ancestor whose genes    mutated 6,000 to 10,000 years ago.    Before then, everyone had brown eyes.
At 6 feet 4 inches (193 cm), he was   tall and "strong enough to intimidate any rival". At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the         assailant by his "neck and the seat   of his trousers" and threw him.
Echidnas /?'k?dn?/, sometimes known   as spiny anteaters, belong to the     family Tachyglossidae in the          monotreme order of egg-laying         mammals. The four extant species,     together with the platypus, are       the only surviving      members of    that order and are the only extant    mammals that lay eggs.
This special edition of Harry Potter  and the Sorcerer's Stone has a        gorgeous new cover illustration by    Kazu Kibuishi. Inside is the full     text of the original novel, with      decorations by Mary GrandPre.         Harry Potter has never been the star  of a   Quidditch team, scoring points while  riding a broom far above the ground.
Today, "aloha kakahiaka" is the       phrase for "good morning." "Aloha     ?auinala" means "good afternoon" and  "aloha ahiahi" means "good evening."  "Aloha kakou" is a common form of     "welcome/goodbye to all."
Adam's apples are found on both women and men they just show up more        prominently in men as a chunk of bony cartilage that's wrapped around the   larynx. Also known as the laryngeal   prominence, the Adam's apple sits     right on top of the thyroid gland, so the area is fittingly called the      thyroid cartilage.
three-dog night. So cold you would    need three dogs in bed with you       to keep warm. Many sources suggest    that the origin is from the           Australian outback. Most of these are providing the origin of the name of a rock band of the same name (see       below) so they  may not be            authoritative.
The United Nations estimates that     there are over three million          shipwrecks on the ocean floors. Lost, destroyed, or deliberately sunk,      these wrecks are of interest to       divers, underwater archaeologists, and        treasure hunters alike.
In the area west of Marquette,        Michigan. Water Volume:               3,000,000,000,000,000 gallons of 440  trillion cubic feet or 10% of the     world's fresh water. Enough to flood  North and South America to one foot   deep. See story about Lake Superior   ice coverage March 2009.
Getting there: The city of Beverly    Hills is located west of Los Angeles  and southwest of Hollywood. It is     surrounded by Bel-Air and Westwood    (to the west), the Santa Monica       Mountains and West Hollywood (to the  north), Hollywood and the Fairfax     district (to the east), and West L.A. & Century City (to the south).
A hat trick originally meant three    goals in a row, with no intervening   goals by either team. Hockey borrowed the term from Cricket. In 1858, a     cricket player in England took three  wickets with consecutive balls, an    incredible trick. As a reward, his    club gave the bowler a new hat, hence the term "hat trick."
Although some will say Please Please  Me was The Beatles' first number one  single, it was their next single,     From Me To You, which topped the      Record Retailer chart – which later   became the Official UK Singles Chart  – on May 2 1963.
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) was adopted as the world's time standard at the   Washington Meridian Conference in     1884. This conference also            established Universal Time, from      which the international 24-hour       time-zone system grew. This is why    all time zones     refer back to GMT  on the prime        meridian.
The Black Sea is an inland sea        located between far-southeastern      Europe and the far-western edges of   the continent of Asia and the country of Turkey. It's bordered by Turkey,   and by the countries of Bulgaria,     Romania, Ukraine, Russia and Georgia.
Serbian-American inventor Nikola      Tesla was born in July of 1856, in    what is now Croatia. He came to the   United States in 1884, and briefly    worked with Thomas Edison before the  two parted ways. He sold several      patent rights, including those to his alternating-current machinery, to     George Westinghouse.
Ruminating mammals include cattle,    goats, sheep, giraffes, bison, moose, elk, yaks, water buffalo, deer,       camels, alpacas, llamas, and          antelope. Ruminants differ from       non-ruminants  (called monogastrics)  because they    have a four-chambered stomach.
Dalmatians are perhaps best known     for their role as fire-fighting       apparatus escorts and firehouse       mascots. Since Dalmatians and horses  are very compatible, the dogs were    easily trained to run in front of the carriages to help clear a path and    quickly guide the horses and          firefighters to the fires.
Migraines are disabling headaches     that most likely stem from problems   with the nerves and blood vessels in  the head. Migraine headaches          typically last from 4-72 hours. They  may occur as often as several times a week to   only once a year. People    who have migraines are called         migraineurs.
A group of daddy long-legs of the     order Opiliones. A widespread myth    holds that daddy longlegs, also known as granddaddy longlegs or harvestmen, are the most venomous spiders in the  world. We're only safe from their     bite, we are told, because their      fangs are too small and weak to break through human skin.
National Prohibition in America       outlawed the sale of alcohol under    the 18th amendment to the             Constitution in 1919. The             Congressional law to implement the    prohibition permitted under the 18th  amendment was the Volstead Act,       coming into operation January, 1920.
To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by   Harper Lee published in 1960. It was  immediately successful, winning the   Pulitzer Prize, and has become a      classic of modern American            literature.
As adults, huntsman spiders do not    build webs, but hunt and forage for   food: their diet consists primarily   of insects and other invertebrates,   and occasionally small skinks and     geckos. They live in the crevices of  tree bark, but will frequently wander into homes and vehicles.
An average professional football game lasts 3 hours and 12 minutes, but if  you tally up the time when the ball   is actually in play, the action       amounts to a mere 11 minutes.
Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe. Virginia    Eliza Clemm Poe (née Clemm;           August 15, 1822 – January 30, 1847)   was the wife of American writer Edgar Allan Poe. The couple were first      cousins and married when Virginia     Clemm was 13 and Poe was 27.
The dimes made by the Philadelphia    Mint in those same years have 113     thin, tightly-spaced reeds. Things    are a little more standardized now    and the Mint lists its reeding        specifications as follows: dimes,     118; quarters, 119; half dollars,     150; dollar, 198; Susan B. Anthony    dollar, 133.
The cracking sound a bullwhip makes   when properly wielded is, in fact, a  small sonic boom. The end of the      whip, known as the "cracker", moves   faster than the speed of sound, thus  creating a sonic boom. The whip is    probably the first human invention to break the sound barrier.
Madagascar's giant, flightless        elephant birds were once a common     sight on the island, certainly up     until the 17th century. It is         generally believed that the elephant  bird's extinction resulted from human activity, perhaps not surprising when one of their giant eggs would have    fed an entire family.
Equivalent to the English word        Indian, okla humma was a phrase in    the Choctaw language used to describe the Native American race as a whole.  Oklahoma later became the de facto    name for Oklahoma Territory, and it   was officially approved in 1890, two  years after the area was opened to    white settlers.
According to the most recent United   Nations estimates, the human          population of the world is expected   to reach 8 billion people in the      spring of 2024. 7 Billion (2011)      According to the United Nations,      world population reached 7 Billion on October 31, 2011.
Veterinarians used to believe that    dogs saw only in black and white, but recent studies suggest that they      actually do have some color           vision—but it's not as bright as a    human's.
Tired eyes get dry, and rubbing       stimulates the lacrimal glands to     produce more fluid. Tiredness also    closes your eyes, so you may rub to   keep them open. Finally, there's a    connection between the muscles that   move your eyes around and your heart. When these muscles are stimulated, a  reflex slows the heart.
If the average night's sleep is eight hours (ie one third of a day), one    sleeps for one third of one's life.   If you live, say, 75 years, that's    25 years asleep, or 9,125 days.
Salting, especially of meat, is an    ancient preservation technique. The   salt draws out moisture and creates   an environment inhospitable to        bacteria. If salted in cold weather   (so that the meat does not spoil      while the salt has time to take       effect), salted meat can last for     years.
Unlike US dimes and quarters, which   stopped being made of 90% silver      after 1964, the composition of a      nickel has essentially been unchanged since the end of World War II. It is  still a 5  gram coin that is an alloy of 75% copper and 25% nickel.
Her Majesty remains the world's       Longest reigning living queen and     will, on 9 September 2015, become the Longest reigning British monarch ever when she surpasses Queen Victoria's   reign of 63 years, seven months and   three days.
Two-liter bottle. US market Coke      Zero bottles, showing 2 L (70.4 imp   fl oz; 67.6 US fl oz) imperial          conversion. Russian market 2.5      litre, 2 litre and 1.5 litre beer     bottles. The two-litre bottle is a    common container for soft drinks.
After the unification of Italy in     1861, when Rome was still under the   control of the Papal States, Turin    was declared the first capital of     Italy, as it was then the capital of  the Piedmont region and home of       ruling the monarchs, the Savoy.
Based on landmass, Vatican City is    the smallest country in the world,    measuring just 0.2 square miles,      almost 120 times smaller than the     island of Manhattan. Situated on the  western bank of the Tiber River,      Vatican City's two-mile border is     landlocked by Italy.
A bruise, also called a contusion     (say: kun-TOO-zhun), forms because    the soft tissues of your body have    been  bumped. Some people bruise      easily, whereas others may have       tougher skin  tissue. When these soft tissues are   injured, small veins    and capillaries  (the tiniest blood   vessels) under the skin sometimes break.
Quite fittingly, the first CD made    in the United States for commercial   release was Bruce Springsteen's 1984  album, "Born in the U.S.A." But it    wasn't the first commercially         available CD ever. That title belongs to Billy Joel's "52nd Street," which  was released on CD in Japan in 1982.
